This directory contains all you need to convert 3D models to building plans for Minecraft on a Windows machine. The binvox executable here is 1.17, viewvox is 0.42; get the latest versions from http://www.patrickmin.com/minecraft/.

Quickstart: double-click on the file voxhand.bat or voxknight.bat. You'll see the conversion take place (takes awhile for the hand, as it's more exacting), then a view of the model will come up. To get out of the viewer, close it and the controlling window (or hit Control-C in that window).

If you want different models, in different formats, see the tutorial thread (second, long link below). Edit the .bat files as you wish.

Documentation: all online, at http://www.patrickmin.com/minecraft/ (where the programs are from) and http://www.minecraftforum.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=55910&sid=6aec7fd0c0a63c1fc482b5390bf2a359&p=1154354#p981947 - ask there if you have problems.
